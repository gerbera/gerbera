1) Release Contents
-------------------------------------------

The Linux SDK for UPnP Devices v1.2 is an SDK for development of UPnP device 
and control point applications for Linux.  It consists of the core UPnP 
protocols along with a UPnP-specific eXtensible Markup Language (XML) parser 
supporting the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 API and an optional, 
integrated mini web server for serving UPnP related documents.

3) System Requirements
-------------------------------------------

The SDK for UPnP Devices is designed to compile and run under the 
Linux operating system.  It does, however, have dependencies on some
packages that may not be installed by default.  All packages that it
requires are listed below.  The name of the package and where it can be 
found is dependent on the distribution of Linux being used.

libpthread  The header and library are installed as part of the glibc-devel
            package (or equivalent).

Additionally, the documentation for the SDK can be auto-generated from 
the UPNP.H header file using DOC++, a documentation system for C, C++, 
IDL, and Java*.  DOC++ generates the documentation in HTML or TeX format.
Using some additional tools, the TeX output can be converted into a
PDF file.  To generate the documentation these tools are required:

DOC++       The homepage for DOC++ is http://docpp.sourceforge.net/.
            The current version as of this release of the SDK is
            version 3.4.9.  DOC++ is the only requirement for generating
            the HTML documentation.
LaTeX/TeX   To generate the PDF documentation, LaTeX and TeX tools are
            necessary.  The tetex and tetex-latex packages provide these
            tools.
dvips       dvips converts the DVI file produced by LaTeX into a PostScript*
            file.  The tetex-dvips package provides this tool.
ps2pdf      The final step to making the PDF is converting the PostStript
            into Portable Document Format.  The ghostscript package provides
            this tool.

For the UPnP library to function correctly, Linux networking must be configured
properly for multicasting.  To do this:

route add -net 239.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 eth0

where 'eth0' is the network adapter that the UPnP library will use.  Without
this addition, device advertisements and control point searches will not
function.

4) Build Instructions
-------------------------------------------

CORE LIBRARIES

The in the examples below, replace $(UPNP) with "libupnp-x.y.z/upnp",
with x, y, and z corresponding to the version of the library that you have.

All pieces of the SDK are built using the same makefile in the $(UPNP) 
directory.  A few of options are available:

% cd $(UPNP)
% make

will build a version of the binaries without debug support and

% cd $(UPNP)
% make DEBUG=1

will build a debug version with symbols support.

Note that all targets are created in $(UPNP)/bin.

To build the documentation:

% cd $(UPNP)
% make doc

makes both the HTML and PDF outputs, assuming all the necessary tools are
installed (see section 3).  To make only the HTML output (requiring only 
DOC++):

% cd $(UPNP)
% make html

To generate the PDF file:

% cd $(UPNP)
% make pdf

In this case, tetex, tetex-latex, tetex-dvips, and ghostscript are necessary
(refer to section 3 for details).

To build the library with the optional, integrated mini web server (note
that this is the default):

% cd $(UPNP)
% make WEB=1

To build without:

% cd $(UPNP)
% make WEB=0

Note that the WEB and DEBUG variables may be combined in any order.

The SDK for Linux also contains some additional helper APIs, declared in
inc/tools/upnptools.h.  If these additional tools are not required, they can
be compiled out:

% cd $(UPNP)
% make TOOLS=0

By default, the tools are included in the library.  Note that the TOOLS,
WEB, and DEBUG variables may be combined in any order.

To further remove code that is not required, the library can be build with or 
with out the control point (client) or device specific code.  To remove this
code:

% cd $(UPNP)
% make CLIENT=0

to remove client only code or:

% cd $(UPNP)
% make DEVICE=0

to remove device only code.

By default, both client and device code is included in the library.  The
integrated web server is automatically removed when building with 
DEVICE=0.  Note that the CLIENT, DEVICE, TOOLS, WEB, and DEBUG variables 
may be combined in any order.

To remove all the targets, object files, and built documentation:

% cd $(UPNP)
% make clean

CROSS COMPILATION

To cross compile the SDK, a special "TARGET" directive is all that is
required:

% cd $(UPNP)
% make TARGET=arm-linux

This will invoke the "arm-linux-gcc" cross compiler to build the library.
The resultant binaries will be in the "bin/arm-linux" directory.  The
binaries are always placed in a directory underneath the "bin" (and 
"bin/debug") directory matching the target name.

SAMPLES

The SDK contains two samples: a TV device application and a control point
that talks with the TV device.  They are found in the $(UPNP)/sample 
directory.  To build the device:

% cd $(UPNP)/sample/tvdevice/linux
% make
% cp upnp_tv_device $(UPNP)/bin
% mkdir $(UPNP)/bin/web
% cp web $(UPNP)/bin/web

To build the sample control point:

% cd $(UPNP)/sample/tvctrlpt/linux
% make
% cp upnp_tv_ctrlpt $(UPNP)/bin

5) Install/Uninstall Instructions
-------------------------------------------

Install

The top-level makefile for the UPnP SDK contains rules to install the 
necessary components.  To install the SDK, as root:

make install

Or, to install the SDK by hand, the binary files, libupnp.so, libixml.so, and
libthreadutil.so (or libthreadutil_dbg.so for a debug build), need to 
be copied (as root) to /lib, /usr/lib, or /usr/local/lib.  Alternatively, the 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH may be changed to include a directory where the binary is 
located.  The SDK header files also need to be copied to a location where 
they can be found.  /usr/include/upnp is a good location for these, 
although it is not necessary.

Uninstall

Likewise, the top-level makefile contains an uninstall rule, reversing 
the steps in the install:

make uninstall

Or, to uninstall the SDK from the machine by hand, remove the binary file 
from where it was placed and remove the directory containing the headers.

6) Product Release Notes
-------------------------------------------

The SDK for UPnP Devices v1.2.1a has these known issues:

- The UPnP library may not work with older versions of gcc and libstdc++, 
  causing a segmentation fault when the library loads.  It is recommended
  that gcc version 2.9 or later be used in building library.
- The UPnP library does not work the glibc 2.1.92-14 that ships with
  Red Hat 7.0.  For the library to function, you must updated the glibc
  and glibc-devel packages to 2.1.94-3 or later.  There is some issue with
  libpthreads that has been resolved in the 2.1.94 version.

7) New Features
-------------------------------------------

Changes to the SDK for UPnP Devices version 1.2.1a:

- Changes the NAME_SIZE constant used for URL buffers to 256 bytes to 
  accomodate longer URLs.

Changes to the SDK for UPnP Devices version 1.2.1:
 
- Integrates an entirely new XML parser that features DOM2 API support and
  a much smaller code size.
- Integrates a new threading utility library that manages all threads in
  the library.
- Elimination of C++ and other code optimizations have reduced the binary
  size by over 60%.
- The web server now supports application-level callbacks to handle 
  dynamically generated data.
- The web server now correctly handles chunked encoding.
- A new client HTTP API has been added that allows downloading of items
  of unlimited size.
- The SDK supports much better cross-compilation support.
- Numerous memory leaks and bugs have been fixed.
