  the case where the <udn> tag was not present.
  Thanks to Nektarios K. Papadopoulos <npapadop@users.sourceforge.net>
  for the report and patch.
- added configure option and adapted the code to completely 
  supress all log output
- added configure option and adapted the code to supress
  debug output
- added taglib support, thanks to Benhur Stein <benhur.stein@gmail.com>
  for the patch. 
- bug 1524468 (startup in daemon mode fails) does no longer occur
  after the integration of libupnp 1.4.x sources
- fixed bug 1292295 (string conversion was failing on 64bit platforms)
- fixed issue with ContainerUpdateIDs (were not sent out along with
  accepted subscription)
- fixed issue where some directories could not be browsed (filesystem 
  browser). It turned out that we forgot to convert the filenames
  to UTF-8, as the result invalid characters made their way into
  the XML that was feeded to the browser.
- improved illegal character conversion handling - in case iconv
  fails we will pad the rest of the name string with "?" and print
  out the failed name in the console.
- we now try to determine the default import charsets by looking
  at the system locale.
- implemented track number metadata extraction (feature request
  1430799). track numbers are now extracted via id3lib/taglib and
  can also be used in the import script. import.js has been adapted
  to add tracknumbers to song names in the Album container.
- added option to supress hidden files when browsing the filesystem
- added X_MS_MediaReceiverRegistrar Service to allow future Xbox 360 
  support
- added workarounds to enable Telegent TG100 avi playback
- server can now be restarted by sending it a SIGHUP
- the current configuration file will never be displayed in the UI and
  will never be added to the database - we do not want the user to
  accidentally share it on the network since it may contain
  security sensitive data
- tomb-install is no longer needed, the server will automatically create
  a default ~/.mediatomb/config.xml file if there is none
- the database tables will be created automatically if they don't
  exist
- adapted configure script to correctly set flags for linkers that
  use the --as-needed option
- the "PC Directory" isn't changeable via the UI anymore to ensure a
  correct view of the "PC Directory"
- lookups in the database are now done with hashes, which should make
  many things faster, especially the adding
- changed the database field "location" from varchar(255) to text to
  allow urls and locations of unlimited size
- created a new theme for the UI
- added support for "blind" .srt requests - some renderers like the
  DSM320 will blindly request the url provided via browse, replacing
  and found file extension with .srt, we will look for the .srt file
  in the directory where the original media is located, using the
  same filename, but with the .srt extension
- created XML schema for "config.xml" to provide the possiblity of
  validating the configuration
- added fallback if js is not available - there is a builtin feature
  to create a default virtual layout now; config.xml has got an
  option to select the virtual-layout type, it can be builting, js or
  disabled.
- added charset option to the import script, it is not possible to
  specify the script encoding
- we now validate filesystem, metadata and scripting charsets upon 
  startup
- added a special option that allows limiting title and description
  lengths in UPnP browse replies to a specified length; this was
  necessary to work around a bug in the TG100 that has problems
  browsing items where title length exceeds 101 characters.
- import.js can now specify the upnp class of the last container in the
  chain
- all items within a container which upnp class is set to 
  object.container.album.musicAlbum will automatically be sorted by 
  track number.
- added option to configure the presentation URL to make it easier
  for NAS vendors to integrate the server into their web UI
- made model number configurable

### MediaTomb v0.8.1	07.09.2005
- added "serve" directory, any files there can be downloaded 
  like from a normal webserver
- implemented keyword extraction for auxdata from libexif
- implemented keyword extraction for auxdata from libextractor
- added Exif metadata support for images via libexif.
- added resolution attribute to image res tag

  and used by import scripts.

  be extracted and filled by the library.

  optional.

  asynchroniously.

- Added target directory option to tomb-install, cleaned up a few
  things.

### MediaTomb v0.7.1  17.04.2005  D-Link DSM-320 fix
- Mappings of mime-types to upnp classes are now configurable.
  Actually this is how we solved the DSM-320 problem - they
  crashed if upnp class of items was different than what the
  DSM expected.

- tomb-install now creates the database and configuration file
  from templates (was hardcoded); also sets the name of the server
  individually for each user (host / username)

- Improved handling of configuration, if non critical options are
  missing we are now setting default values.

### MediaTomb v0.7    14.04.2005  First release
- The changelog does not start at day 0, updates will be made
  starting from this release.
