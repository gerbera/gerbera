UPnP
~~~~
Gerbera implements the UPnP MediaServer V 1.0 specification that can be found on http://www.upnp.org/.
The current implementation focuses on parts that are required by the specification, however we look into extending the
functionality to cover the optional parts of the spec as well.

Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a set of networking protocols that permits networked devices, such as PCs, printers, mobile phones
TVs, stereos, amplifiers and more to seamlessly discover each other's presence on the network and network services
for data sharing,
